            Happy new year, darling. well, even though my year didn’t start with you, it definitely will this coming one. 
            Another year, another battle for us. But, this coming one will definitely be something I’ll look forward to. 
            Because you are there, I’ll make sure you’ll be with me. I know I made a lot of mistakes, hurt you, and those 
            are something I can never correct. But, I’ll be better. With you, I never see myself being so much better. 
            This time, it will always be you.

            This 2026, we’ll have more time together, we will have more memories to create and cherish. I’m really glad that 
            I was able to meet you. 2025 was not something good for me, but you erased all of the reason to hate it. I never 
            find myself in anything, but with you, I saw myself trying again. So, please don’t ever say that I’ll ever get 
            tired of loving you. I want you by my side while I’m doing my best to achieve everything I want. Although, I 
            already achieved you MHEHEWHW. I’m really glad that I met you, it was the best thing that happened to me. Know 
            that I’ll always be by your side too. I’m proud of everything you did this year. 2025 taught us a lot, and 
            incoming years I want to learn more with you. I’ll always choose you. No matter the challenge, we will overcome 
            everything, together. May 2026 be good to you, darling. I love you more than you could ever know 😚😚😚😚😚
        </p>
