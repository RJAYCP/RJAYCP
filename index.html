<h1>Happy New Year, Darling 🎆</h1>

<p>
Happy new year, darling. Well, even though my year didn’t start with you,  
it definitely will this coming one. Another year, another battle for us.  
But this coming one will definitely be something I’ll look forward to.  
Because you are there, I’ll make sure you’ll be with me.
</p>

<p>
I know I made a lot of mistakes, hurt you, and those are something I can never correct.  
But I’ll be better. With you, I never see myself being so much better.  
This time, it will always be you.
</p>

<p>
This 2026, we’ll have more time together. We will have more memories to create and cherish.  
I’m really glad that I was able to meet you. 2025 was not something good for me,  
but you erased all of the reasons to hate it.
</p>

<p>
I never found myself in anything, but with you, I saw myself trying again.  
It’s not something to brag about, but I was definitely trying because I am with you.  
So please don’t ever say that I’ll get tired of loving you.
</p>

<p>
You’re the reason why I want to be better, why I want to be myself,  
and why I want to achieve more. I’m asking you again to keep holding on to me.  
I want you to be by my side while I’m doing my best to achieve everything I want —  
although I already achieved you (MHEHEWHW).
</p>

<p>
I’m really glad that I met you. It was the best thing that happened to me.  
Know that I’ll always be by your side too. I’ll be here throughout everything,  
every single time, I would be with you.
</p>

<p>
I’m proud of everything you did this year. Whether you say you didn’t achieve anything —  
you did a lot. And even if you really didn’t, I’m proud of you for trying.
</p>

<p>
2025 taught us a lot, and in the incoming years, I want to learn more — with you.  
Everything should be with you. I’ll be incomplete without you.  
I can never be myself again without you in it.
</p>

<p>
Throughout everything, I’ll always choose you. No matter the challenge,  
we will overcome everything — together.
</p>

<p>
May 2026 be good to you, darling.  
I love you more than you could ever know 😚😚😚😚😚
